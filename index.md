# This is where I'm going to start organizing notes. 

The first thing we will do is demonstrate a [[link]].

Here's the way this works. You write a "link" in double square-brackets, and then ctrl-click/hover over it, and foam (?) will automatically create a file for that link, named whatever text is in the square brackets. 

Here's another [[example]].

I think ctrl-hover -> creates/shows link, ctrl-click -> goes to link. 

This seems like a good time to start a [[foam]] link, that just contains foam tips. 

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[link]: link.md "Link"
[example]: example.md "Example"
[foam]: foam.md "Foam"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
